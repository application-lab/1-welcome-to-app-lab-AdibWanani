# About Me
Hello World! My name is Adib El Ounani and I'm from Rabat, Morocco. I think I want to major in a STEM related field. I spend much of my free time tinkering, woodworking or just fixing stuff. My plaground was a jumble of disassabled toys, screws and drills. I want to pursue my quest of learning and feeding my curiosity through your course, where I want to push limits. Thank you!
